Skinfold measurement is one of the most popular and practical methods for estimating percent body fat. Body composition is a term that describes the relative proportions of fat, bone, and muscle mass in the human body. Following the collection of skinfold measurements, regression analysis (a statistical procedure used to predict a dependent variable based on one or more independent or predictor variables) is used to estimate total percent body fat in humans.
